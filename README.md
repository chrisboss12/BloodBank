# BloodBankIE

Final CA Project (BSc. Honours Computing in Cloud Computing)

During my studies, I worked on the BloodBankIE project, which involved developing a hybrid blood bank management system. 
This cloud-based solution stored, processed, retrieved, and analysed information related to administration and inventory 
management of blood banks. The system was designed to be accessible online or offline, providing flexibility and convenience 
for users.

Throughout the project, I utilised my skills in programming languages such as Java, C#, PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. 
I also applied my knowledge of database management, using NoSQL (Google Firestore) to handle data storage and retrieval. 
Additionally, I employed agile development methodologies to ensure efficient and iterative progress.

In terms of specific contributions, I played a role in designing and implementing the system's functionality, including features 
for managing blood inventory, processing orders, and generating reports. I also collaborated with team members to conduct testing 
and maintenance activities, ensuring the system's reliability and performance.

Overall, my involvement in the BloodBankIE project allowed me to apply my technical skills in software development, 
database management, and agile methodologies to create a practical solution for blood bank management.
